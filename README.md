# Road of Rinth

This is the website for Road of Rinth, a hobby web-novel created by HoiMeTem.

Here you will find links to the chapters published, as well as more information, perhaps in the form of news and stuff.

This project was mainly built for me to sharpen up my Code-Writing skills after trying to sharpen up my English-Writing skills. _(Oh and also all my friends want websites for their own stories so why don't I make one for myself too?)_

### What is Road of Rinth?

Road of Rinth is an action-adventure web-novel with a contemporary fantasy setting which spans across (a planned) 8 arcs.

It is a hobby project by me, so ~~consistency in chapter releases will never be a thing.~~

More information can be found in the website. _Otherwise, why the hell would I make it in the first place??_
